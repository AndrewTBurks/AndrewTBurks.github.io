          I am a Ph.D. Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am currently a Research Assistant at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at UIC. I have experience working on research projects related to data visualization and the development of collaborative software for large/tiled displays.

          Through my work, I have gained hands-on experience in two main areas: <strong>Data Visualization and Visual Analytics, and Human Computer Interaction</strong>. Broadly, I am interested in the role of visualization and "human-data" interfaces in analytical processes and workflows.

        <h2>My Work</h2>

        <p>
          In the data visualization research in which I participated, I applied domain-agnostic design to visualization projects across <strong>
            domain science
          </strong>
          , <strong>
            social good
          </strong>, <strong>
            operational workflow support
          </strong>. My science-supporting visualization research was carried out across a broad range of scientific domains from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), to biology and precision medicine, to high-capacity networking instrumentation.
        </p>

          Additionally, I work on the SAGE2 collaborative system. SAGE2â„¢ - Scalable Amplified Group Environment is an NSF $5M project to build a web-based system for tiled display walls to enhance data intensive co-located and remote collaboration. My research in SAGE2 focuses on providing expressive support to collaborative data exploration workflows. My first two projects were an application for visualizing arbitrary Comma-Separated Value (CSV) formatted data, and a layout system which supports the application of geometric layout constraints to digital content in the freeform collaborative workspace. My current research focuses on supporting data exploration within the SAGE2 workspace. To this end, I have created a JupyterLab extension allowing users to display notebooks and reactive notebook cells in SAGE2. To build native support into SAGE2 for the exploratory analysis seen in Jupyter Notebooks, I designed and implemented the "VisSnippets" system in SAGE2. Supporting impromptu collaborative data exploration, VisSnippets allows users to write and compose modular analysis blocks for data retrieval, transformation/analysis, and visualization into branching data pipelines.
