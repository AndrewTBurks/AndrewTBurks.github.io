abstract: "To better integrate existing data science workflows into the SAGE2 collaborative experience, we provide a SAGE2 plugin for JupyterLab. The plugin supports sharing both static notebooks, as well as dynamically updating cell content to SAGE2. A user simply connects to one or more SAGE2 server by URL, and can start sharing their Jupyter Notebook content. Shared notebooks are rendered by Jupyter nbviewer as static web-pages on the SAGE2 wall. Shared notebook cell image output is sent as an image to SAGE2 and dynamically updates every time that a cell is run."
