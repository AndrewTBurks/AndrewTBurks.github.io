abstract: "Our contest submission aimed to develop a static visual representation that shows how geographic and seasonal changes in the availability of the ACT test affects nearby or adjacent testing sites, by moving students or assessments, changing dates, or some other strategy. The Voronoi visualization (Top Middle) encodes test center distribution at regional level (Illinois) by partitioning each region based on distances to test centers. The Voronoi cell intensity is mapped to Assigned/Capacity; the darker the cell, the higher demand in that region."
