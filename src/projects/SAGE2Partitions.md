abstract: "While SAGE2 allows users the complete freedom to organize their content, SAGE2 Partitions aim to provide optional structure to the organization. SAGE2 partitions can act as divisions of the screen space, deforming their neighbors when resized. The Partitions can be 'un-snapped' to allow for free movement, becoming a simple grouping of applications. Partitions can be 'tiled' organizing the content within into a grid. As content is added or removed from a Partiton, the groupings are dynamically updated and content dynamically rearranged. Click-and-drag interaction can be used both to create new Partitions in an empty space and essentially select apps to grab, or to 'cut' existing Partitions to divide the size and content."
