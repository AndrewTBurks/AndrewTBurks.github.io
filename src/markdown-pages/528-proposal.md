## Description

you should create a web page that describes the project that you want to do

### References

along with any reference material that would help convince me that this is a good project

### Benefit of VR

Tell me why VR will be beneficial here and what you expect to gain

### Platform

Tell me which platform or platforms you want to develop your application for

You should then email the location of that web page to andy
I will then make links to all those projects available on the class web pages so everyone can see what everyone else is doing
Once andy approves of your project you move onto the implementation phase
