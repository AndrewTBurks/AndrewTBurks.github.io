## Source and Installation

The source code for the application can be found at:

#### [**GitHub** @AndrewTBurks/528P2_Burks <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AndrewTBurks/528P2_Burks)

To _Install_ and _Run_ the application, clone the repository locally and add the project to UnityHub or open it in Unity using **Version 2019.2.11f**.

By default, the project should be configured to run on Desktop using the CAVE2 Simulator from the omicron-unity module. To configure to run for Vive, go to the Omicron menu and select **Configure for Vive**. Similarly, to run in CAVE2, return to the same menu and select **Configure for CAVE2** and follow the [rest of the build/run steps](https://github.com/uic-evl/omicron-unity/wiki/Guide-for-running-Unity-in-CAVE2#building-on-cave2).

All Assets and packages required are included in the repository, and the Library folder should rebuild when opened in Unity.
