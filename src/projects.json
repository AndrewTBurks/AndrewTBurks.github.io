    "abstract": "To better integrate existing data science workflows into the SAGE2 collaborative experience, we provide a SAGE2 plugin for JupyterLab. The plugin supports sharing both static notebooks, as well as dynamically updating cell content to SAGE2. A user simply connects to one or more SAGE2 server by URL, and can start sharing their Jupyter Notebook content. Shared notebooks are rendered by Jupyter nbviewer as static web-pages on the SAGE2 wall. Shared notebook cell image output is sent as an image to SAGE2 and dynamically updates every time that a cell is run.",

    "abstract": "We present our submission to the SciVis Data Contest 2016. Our submission was a web-based tool for the visual analysis of multi-run fluid flow simulation data. The tool en- ables the summarization and comparison of ensemble simulation runs. The back-end implements an algorithm for the identifica- tion and tracking of features (viscous fingers and their properties) in transient, fluid flow simulations. The front-end allows users to explore 3D simulation run data using linked 3D views and vertical slabs for specific timesteps, a merge-tree view linked to these spatial representations, and Kiviat diagrams for exploring run properties. We evaluate the tool with a computational fluid dynamics expert and report his feedback.",

    "abstract": "In the Englewood Community Area in Chicago, the youth face two main obstacles they face when looking for nearby social services. First, they may not be aware of some of the services around them. Second, these services that they need may not exist in their area. In the Englewood Community Area, it is a particularly dire situation as many children are in danger or are in lack of basic human needs. To help solve this problem, we implement two web-based tools -- one for volunteers to help find services for children, and the other to analyze the service availability to ensure the equity of social services.",

    "name": "Dynamic Influence Networks for Rule-Based Models",
    "abstract": "We introduce the Dynamic Influence Network (DIN), a novel visual analytics technique for representing and analyzing rule-based models of protein-protein interaction networks. Rule-based modeling has proved instrumental in developing biological models that are concise, comprehensible, easily extensible, and that mitigate the combinatorial complexity of multi-state and multi-component biological molecules. Our technique visualizes the dynamics of these rules as they evolve over time. Using the data produced by KaSim, an open source stochastic simulator of rule-based models written in the Kappa language, DINs provide a node-link diagram that represents the influence that each rule has on the other rules. That is, rather than representing individual biological components or types, we instead represent the rules about them (as nodes) and the current influence of these rules (as links). Using our interactive DIN-Viz software tool, researchers are able to query this dynamic network to find meaningful patterns about biological processes, and to identify salient aspects of complex rule-based models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we investigate a simulation of a circadian clock model that illustrates the oscillatory behavior of the KaiC protein phosphorylation cycle.",

    "name": "SAGE2 Partitions",
    "abstract": "While SAGE2 allows users the complete freedom to organize their content, SAGE2 Partitions aim to provide optional structure to the organization. SAGE2 partitions can act as divisions of the screen space, deforming their neighbors when resized. The Partitions can be 'un-snapped' to allow for free movement, becoming a simple grouping of applications. Partitions can be 'tiled' organizing the content within into a grid. As content is added or removed from a Partiton, the groupings are dynamically updated and content dynamically rearranged. Click-and-drag interaction can be used both to create new Partitions in an empty space and essentially select apps to grab, or to 'cut' existing Partitions to divide the size and content.",

The environment intertwines a statistical martingale model and a K Nearest Neighbor approach with visual encodings, including novel interactive nomograms, in order to compute and explain a patient's probability of survival as a function of similar patient results. A coordinated views paradigm enables exploration of the multivariate, heterogeneous and few-valued data from a large head and neck cancer repository. A visual scaffolding approach further enables users to build from familiar representations to unfamiliar ones.",

    "abstract": "We present a web-based visual analysis tool for the exploration of peak distributions over state space and simulation time in such stochastic networks, and the comparison of peak distributions between multiple simulations. Our approach combines multiple linked views to capture ensemble time-evolving probability landscapes. A peak trajectory cube provides users an overview of peak spatiotemporal distributions between six simulations. A peak projection map shows the exact peak locations of multiple simulations at the user selected time. At a more detailed level, users can inspect a particular state in the peak projection map to view for each simulation both the probability values over time, and the local probability landscape shapes. This information is displayed in a small multiple using two glyphs: profile glyphs and arrow glyphs. The arrow glyph indicates that a state is a peak when all the glyph eight arrows point towards the glyph center.",

The Voronoi cell intensity is mapped to Assigned/Capacity; the darker the cell, the higher demand in that region.",
